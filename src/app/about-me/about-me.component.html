        Hello, my name is Fabian, I'm a front-end developer from Siegen,
        Germany. I've been interested in all kinds of technology for years, be it PC hardware, mobile
        phones,
        laptops or other devices.
        The world of technology inspires me, and for this reason I decided to become a front-end developer.
        Now
        I understand not only the hardware, but also the software.

          I enjoy bringing ideas to life, planning carefully, write clean code and
          good
          documentation. Working in a team is also a lot of fun, and I am always open to agile working
          methods.

          After completing my retraining, I am very excited to start a brand new
          career
          as a developer and continue to grow professionally! If you think I'd be a good match for your
          company, feel free to contact me!
